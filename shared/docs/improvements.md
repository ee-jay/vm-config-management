# Webby Server Improvements

## Suggested Directory Structure

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Development Environment

- [ ] Use Docker volumes for POServer development
- [ ] Add development/production environment configurations
- [ ] Implement proper logging setup
- [ ] Add health checks to services

### 2. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Move sensitive data from docker-compose.yml to .env
- [ ] Review nginx configuration for security best practices
- [ ] Implement container resource limits
- [ ] Add proper SSL/TLS configuration

### 3. Database Management

- [ ] Implement proper backup rotation
- [ ] Add database migration scripts
- [ ] Add data seeding mechanism
- [ ] Document database schema

### 4. CI/CD Possibilities

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for POServer
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Add deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring

## Immediate Concerns

1. **Nginx Configuration**

   - Currently mounting POServer directly
   - Need to review for security and performance

2. **Postgres Setup**

   - Additional security configurations needed
   - Backup strategy review

3. **PgAdmin Configuration**

   - Security enhancements needed
   - Access control review

4. **Docker Compose Structure**
   - Split into development and production versions
   - Review volume mounts
   - Add container health checks

## Next Steps

1. Choose an area to focus on
2. Review POServer git repository structure
3. Set up development workflow
4. Review and enhance nginx configuration

## Notes

- POServer is a git repository - needs special consideration in deployment
- Current setup is using latest tags for images - should consider fixed versions
- External nginx network being used - review network security
