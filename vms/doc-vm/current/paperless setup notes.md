- Scripts set up for ESTL & MSP dispatch sheets to save pdfs to gdrive instead of emailing. once in this drive, rclone runs via a cron job on the doc server host every 5 minutes using the rclone move command, which removes the file from gdrive, moving it to the paperless consume directory on the host(/mnt/paperless_storage_ssd/consume).

  - scripts that run under different emails -- make sure that the account has access to the google drive folder. Dispatch sheeets weren't making it through because the email sending them were the dispatch gmails. I had to add those emails as editors to the gdrive folder. The files were also not being deleted because the scripts that send the file over were running under other emails. I fixed it and they now set ownership of the pdfs they creat to sheets.eejay@gmail.com before sending the pdf.

  - **OWNERSHIP TRANSFER ISSUES RESOLVED** - Removed all ownership transfer code from scripts due to access denied errors. The "DriveApp.access denied" errors were caused by attempting to transfer ownership of files in shared folders. New approach eliminates ownership transfer entirely and uses a "kick back" cleanup system instead.

  - **FOLDER CONFUSION ISSUE** - Discovered multiple PaperlessUploads folders existed with different IDs:

    - sheets.eejay@gmail.com: `1zbRL3BsZ_NfmiDmsebFbZBM_4LgvILNT`
    - eejaydispatch@gmail.com: `1WAZFhqfw7pofpUXIyd-cVT39NGCXlHP8` **DELETED**
    - `DriveApp.getFoldersByName()` could return the wrong folder, causing cleanup scripts to work on empty folders

  - **NEW CLEANUP SYSTEM** - Implemented two-tier cleanup to handle the ownership/folder issues:

    1. **Main Account Cleanup** (`mainAccountCleanup.js`) - Runs every 10 minutes on sheets.eejay@gmail.com
       - Removes files >9 minutes old from PaperlessUploads folder
       - Ensures rclone has processed files before deletion
       - When files are removed, they "kick back" to other users' drives
    2. **User Account Cleanup** (`dispatchSheetCleanup.js`) - Runs daily on other accounts
       - Searches root directory for dispatch sheet PDFs
       - Uses case-insensitive search for "dispatch sheet" filenames
       - Cleans up "kicked back" files

  - **SCRIPT PROTECTION** - `dispatchSheetCleanup.js` now includes `isProtectedFile()` function to prevent deletion of:

    - Google Apps Script files (.gs, .js)
    - Google Workspace files (Sheets, Docs, etc.)
    - Files with "script" in the name
    - Clasp configuration files

  - **UPDATED ARCHIVE SCRIPT** - `archive_to_drive_ESTL.js` improvements:
    - Removed ownership transfer code (source of errors)
    - Added `targetSheet` parameter to avoid active sheet context issues
    - Enhanced error handling with email fallback
    - Better integration with `ResetPageNew()` script

- workflows to tag dispatch sheets & transfer books are based on file names including strings like "ESTL Dispatch SHeet". Paperless finds keywords for nearly all shipper tags in these files so each one has 2 workflows. 1. at time of consumption, with string match of "ESTL Dispatch SHeet", it sets the 'ESTL' and 'Dispatch sheet' tags, which are needed to trigger the step 2 flows. These run after the document is added and remove ALL tags then reassign the 'ESTL' and "dispatch sheet' tags.
