- Scripts set up for ESTL & MSP dispatch sheets to save pdfs to gdrive instead of emailing. once in this drive, rclone runs via a cron job on the doc server host every 5 minutes using the rclone move command, which removes the file from gdrive, moving it to the paperless consume directory on the host(/mnt/paperless_storage_ssd/consume).

  - scripts that run under different emails -- make sure that the account has access to the google drive folder. Dispatch sheeets weren't making it through because the email sending them were the dispatch gmails. I had to add those emails as editors to the gdrive folder. The files were also not being deleted because the scripts that send the file over were running under other emails. I fixed it and they now set ownership of the pdfs they creat to sheets.eejay@gmail.com before sending the pdf.

- workflows to tag dispatch sheets & transfer books are based on file names including strings like "ESTL Dispatch SHeet". Paperless finds keywords for nearly all shipper tags in these files so each one has 2 workflows. 1. at time of consumption, with string match of "ESTL Dispatch SHeet", it sets the 'ESTL' and 'Dispatch sheet' tags, which are needed to trigger the step 2 flows. These run after the document is added and remove ALL tags then reassign the 'ESTL' and "dispatch sheet' tags.
